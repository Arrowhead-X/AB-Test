    "`Experimentation` has become a non-negotiable factor in keeping up with the dynamic nature of customers, helping to understand what works or doesnt work. \n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of experimentation is `learning.` Learning about customers, market segments, price sensitivity, choice, impact of specific features, the list is endless. AB Test is an interesting way to achieve the learning goal of experimentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### What is an AB Test?\n",
    "\n",
    "An AB Test simply means comparing two or multiple versions of an initiative backed up by a hypothesis (Which can be a new feature to your software program, modification to your website load-time speed, advertising copy, or evening your Call-to-Action button). If it impacts your KPIs then it should be tested.\n",
    "\n",
    "An AB test always starts with an hypothesis. For example, you can propose that adding a new feature to your software program would increase the number of purchases that happen by users who visit your website. The truth is that you don't know if that holds true when the feature is eventually launched but that statement becomes your hypothesis, which you can then test with any experimentation method [An AB Test in this case].\n",
    "\n",
    "For this short project, we go through a simple AB Test life-cyle for changes made to a webpage. We want to know if there is a significant change in conversion rate if we switch to a new webpage. Since we do not know the answer yet, we can run an AB Test to verify our hypothesis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our hypothesis - Changing our webpage will increase our conversion rate by `3%`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Out hypothesis simply states that if we had a conversion rate on `15%` with the old page, launching our new page will increase this conversion rate to `18%`"

    "##### Business Problem\n",
    "Arrowhead Inc is an E-commerce web platform with a variety of products and a wide range of customers. With a goal to improve the number of completed orders that they have [completed orders mean that the customer visited the website, bought a product and paid for it], they decide to redesign their product description page with some specific changes drawing the users' attention to the `Call-to-Action` button with an attractive colour.\n",
    "\n",
    "The success of this change is not known beforehand and completely implementing this change only leaves fate to decide if it achieves the desired goal or not. We wouldn't want to waste resources and time before finding out that our initiative delivered the required result, rather we would test the new changes and compare the desired results with the existing web page design to know if we are on track with our goals, and that is the purpose of experimentation [AB Test in this use case].\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Hypotheses\n",
    "Null Hypothesis (H0) = Changing the outlook of our product description page will not increase our conversion rate by `3%` i.e. There is no significant difference between the old and new product page.\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternative Hypothesis (H1) = Changing the outlook of our product description page will increase our conversion rate by `3%`i.e. A significant difference exists between the old and new product page.\n",
    "\n",
    "The null hypothesis simply summarizes the point that if for example we have `100 customers` visiting our old web page and `15` of them end up buying the products, making changes to the web page will increase that number from `15` to `18` completed orders for every `100` customers that visit the new webpage.\n",
    "\n",
    "Assuming that each customer spends and average of `$1,000`:\n",
    "the old webpage generates `$15,000` monthly while the new webpage will generate $18,000 monthly, a `$3,000` increase"
