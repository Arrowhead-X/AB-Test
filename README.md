# AB-Test

Releasing a new app feature, designing or adjusting wep page components, either for accessibility or functionality without the ability to know if such changes would affect the success metric(s) the organisation is interested in can be sometimes terrifying, begging the need for experimentation.

While A/B test is the focus of this project, understanding that the concept of experimentation is broader than just A/B. The goal of experimentation is to understand what works and what doesn't work. A/B test is a method of experimentation. We use this method to determine the statistical significance/if there was a significant difference in the rate at which customers purchase the product when they visit the old web platform vs when they visit the new product page design.
